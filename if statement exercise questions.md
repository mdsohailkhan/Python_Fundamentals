Triangle Validity Checker: Write a program that takes three side lengths as input and checks if they form a valid triangle (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).
Multiple Conditions: Ask the user to input a number. Use if statements to print whether the number is "small" (less than 10), "medium" (between 10 and 20), or "large" (greater than 20).
Number Sign Checker: Take a number as input and use if statements to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero, but with nested if conditions to categorize large and small positive numbers.
Odd-Even within a Range: Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is odd or even, and then checks if it is within the range of 1 to 50. Print different messages based on the conditions.
Simple Calculator: Create a program that takes two numbers and a math operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and uses if statements to perform the corresponding operation.
Discount Checker: Write a program that asks the user to input the total amount of a purchase. Use if statements to apply a discount based on the amount (e.g., 10% off for more than $100, 20% off for more than $200).
Temperature Range: Take a temperature as input and print "Cold" if the temperature is below 15°C, "Warm" if it’s between 15°C and 30°C, and "Hot" if it’s above 30°C.
BMI Calculator: Write a program that takes the user's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI. Use if statements to categorize the BMI into "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," or "Obese."
Day of the Week: Ask the user for a number between 1 and 7 and print the corresponding day of the week (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.) using if statements.
String Comparison: Write a program that takes two strings as input and uses if statements to check if they are the same length or if one is longer than the other.
Login System: Ask the user for a username and password. Use if statements to check if they match predefined values. If both are correct, print "Login Successful"; otherwise, print "Invalid Username or Password."

Letter Grade to GPA: Ask the user to input a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and use if statements to print the corresponding GPA (e.g., A = 4.0, B = 3.0, etc.).
Palindrome Checker: Write a program that takes a string as input and uses if statements to check if it’s a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Weekday or Weekend: Ask the user to input a number representing the day of the week (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday), and use if statements to print whether it's a "Weekday" or "Weekend."
